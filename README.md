## Bugs

-Tried to create a GitHub page and run that page compatible with CodeAnyWhere and made mistakes. Likewise, made a lot of mistakes while creating the project. To correct those mistakes, repeated the lessons which had completed, got help from many different resources.

-The resources I use the most when planning, creating and correcting my project;

*Slack (https://slack.com/)

  *Mentor


-Writing wrong code, making mistakes in punctuation marks, diving into codes so much that you forget what you are looking for after long searches, seeing code even in dreams... All these things tire the mind and lead to more mistakes. In this case, a good mentor, Slack correspondence as an example of how to find a way, and it is comforting to see that there are people hanging out in the same places as you. Thus, you can focus on finding a solution without being stuck in the problem.

-The excitement of the experience of the second project, which came with new information and many trials, was tiring, but it was and hopefully will be nice at the end.
