-As the text color of the question, black was preferred for compatibility with space.

## Bugs

-Tried to create a GitHub page and run that page compatible with CodeAnyWhere and made mistakes. Likewise, made a lot of mistakes while creating the project. To correct those mistakes, repeated the lessons which had completed, got help from many different resources.

-The resources I use the most when planning, creating and correcting my project;

*Mentor

-Writing wrong code, making mistakes in punctuation marks, diving into codes so much that you forget what you are looking for after long searches, seeing code even in dreams... All these things tire the mind and lead to more mistakes. In this case, a good mentor, Slack correspondence as an example of how to find a way, and it is comforting to see that there are people hanging out in the same places as you. Thus, you can focus on finding a solution without being stuck in the problem.

-The excitement of the experience of the second project, which came with new information and many trials, was tiring, but it was and hopefully will be nice at the end.

## Testing

-No errors are present in the console

-Each answer can only be submitted once

-Verified that score increments when correct answers are submitted

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

-Forked the CI repository

-Created a new GitHub repo for the forked branch

-Launched the repo in CodeAnywhere

-From the terminal, did the initial git add / commit / push

-In github, navigated to settings > pages

-Selected the main branch & pressed save. Once the main branch has been selected, the page provided the link to the completed website.
